# your-weather-app

This is a simple JavaScript ES6+ PWA (Progressive Web Application) weather app that takes a city name and returns the current weather for that city by using the 
openweathermap API. I have consciously chosen to make this app minimal. There are no libraries, frameworks, tests,
task runners, build tools, etc.

Tech used:

JavaScript ES6+

HTML5

CSS3
